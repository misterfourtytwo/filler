## Current Focus: Canvas Detail Page Error Fix âœ… COMPLETED

**Status**: Successfully fixed error that occurred when opening canvas details page.

### What Was Accomplished

#### 1. Design System Refinement âœ…
- **Updated `lib/ui/design_system.dart`** with Apple-inspired design tokens:
  - Refined spacing values (spaceMd: 16, spaceLg: 24, spaceXl: 32)
  - Updated border radius values for consistency
  - Added new animation durations (instant: 100ms, fast: 150-200ms, normal: 250-300ms)
  - Enhanced canvas sizing (mobile: 32px, desktop: 40px, thumbnail: 16px)
  - Replaced color palette with Apple-inspired colors (Pure White, Pure Black, Light Gray, Blue, etc.)
  - Updated shadows to use `withValues()` instead of deprecated `withOpacity()`
  - Added missing responsive methods (`isMobile`, `isTablet`, `isDesktop`, `getAdaptiveSpacing`)
  - Added missing spacing constants (`spaceXxl`, `spaceXxxl`)

#### 2. Theme Data Transformation âœ…
- **Complete `ThemeData` overhaul** with Apple Storefront aesthetics:
  - AppBar: 17px font size, -0.4 letter spacing, refined icon theming
  - Divider: 0.2 alpha outline, 1px space
  - Input Decoration: Consistent border radius, refined padding
  - Buttons: 17px font size, -0.4 letter spacing, elegant padding
  - Cards: Subtle borders with 0.1 alpha outline
  - Chips: 15px font size, -0.2 letter spacing
  - Icons: Consistent 24px size
  - Text Theme: Complete typography system with Apple-inspired font sizes, weights, letter spacing, and line heights

#### 3. Color Schemes Enhancement âœ…
- **Renamed and refined color schemes**:
  - `premiumColorScheme` â†’ `sleekLightColorScheme`
  - `premiumDarkColorScheme` â†’ `sleekDarkColorScheme`
  - Added `surfaceContainer` variants for better layering
  - Updated all color values to match Apple's aesthetic

#### 4. Animation System Removal âœ…
- **Removed all animation methods** from `DesignSystem`:
  - Removed `createStaggeredAnimation()` method
  - Removed `createScaleAnimation()` method
  - Removed `createFadeAnimation()` method
  - Removed `createSlideAnimation()` method
  - Removed all animation duration constants and easing curves

#### 5. Home Page Animation Removal âœ…
- **Removed all animations** from `lib/features/home/presentation/home_page.dart`:
  - Removed animated background with gradient effects
  - Removed floating particles animation
  - Removed animated header with floating effect
  - Removed `TickerProviderStateMixin` and animation controllers
  - Removed `BackgroundPainter` and `FloatingParticlesPainter` classes
  - Maintained clean, minimalistic layout and functionality

#### 6. Pattern Palette Animation Removal âœ…
- **Removed all animations** from `lib/ui/uikit/pattern_palette.dart`:
  - Removed entrance animations (fade and slide transitions)
  - Removed staggered animation for pattern grid items
  - Removed selection animation controller
  - Removed `TickerProviderStateMixin` and animation controllers
  - Maintained clean grid layout and selection functionality

#### 7. Canvas Grid Animation Removal âœ…
- **Removed all animations** from `lib/features/canvas/presentation/widgets/canvas_grid.dart`:
  - Removed entrance animations (fade, slide, and scale transitions)
  - Removed interaction animation controller
  - Removed `TickerProviderStateMixin` and animation controllers
  - Replaced `AnimatedContainer` with regular `Container`
  - Maintained all pixel interaction functionality and visual styling

#### 8. Additional Animation Removal âœ…
- **Removed animations from other components**:
  - **Theme Switch Tile**: Removed `AnimatedContainer` with duration and curve
  - **Angle Picker**: Removed entrance animations, selection animations, and `AnimatedContainer`
  - **Home Page**: Removed unused `dart:math` import
  - All components maintain their visual design and functionality without animations

#### 9. Preferences Page Enhancement âœ…
- **Enhanced preferences page layout**:
  - **App Bar**: Hidden for desktop layout, shown for mobile layout
  - **Scrolling**: Added `SingleChildScrollView` to desktop layout for better content accessibility
  - **Responsive Design**: Maintained existing mobile layout with `ListView` scrolling
  - **Import**: Added `DesignSystem` import to preferences page for responsive detection

#### 10. Canvas Detail Page Error Fix âœ…
- **Fixed critical error** in `lib/features/gallery/presentation/gallery_bloc.dart`:
  - **Issue**: `_Delete` event handler was duplicating pixel data decoding logic instead of reusing existing logic
  - **Problem**: Used `_repo.getAll()` and manual JSON decoding instead of `_repo.getAllModels()` which properly handles conversion
  - **Solution**: Updated `_Delete` event to use same logic as `_Load` event with `_repo.getAllModels()`
  - **Result**: Canvas detail page now opens without errors and maintains consistent data handling
  - **Cleanup**: Removed unused `dart:convert` import from gallery bloc

#### 11. GlobalKey Duplicate Error Fix âœ…
- **Fixed critical GlobalKey error** in `lib/features/gallery/presentation/canvas_detail_page.dart`:
  - **Issue**: `GlobalKey` was being created inside the `build` method, causing duplicate key errors
  - **Problem**: `final boundaryKey = GlobalKey();` in build method created new key on every rebuild
  - **Solution**: Moved `GlobalKey` to class field as `final GlobalKey _boundaryKey = GlobalKey();`
  - **Result**: Canvas detail page now opens without Flutter framework errors
  - **Impact**: Resolved "Duplicate GlobalKey detected in widget tree" error

#### 12. RepaintBoundary Conflict Fix âœ…
- **Fixed RepaintBoundary conflict** in `lib/features/gallery/presentation/canvas_detail_page.dart`:
  - **Issue**: Both `CanvasDetailPage` and `CanvasGrid` were using `RepaintBoundary` with conflicting keys
  - **Problem**: Double `RepaintBoundary` wrapping caused widget tree conflicts and duplicate key errors
  - **Solution**: Removed outer `RepaintBoundary` and let `CanvasGrid` handle its own boundary with separate export key
  - **Result**: Eliminated widget tree conflicts and resolved remaining GlobalKey issues
  - **Impact**: Canvas detail page now renders correctly without framework errors
